### Three User Roles ✓

3. **Other** - External users (faculty/staff)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Create Admin User

Go to Supabase Dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard):

1. Navigate to: **Authentication → Users**
2. Click **"Add user"** → **"Create new user"**
3. Enter:
   - Email: `yogafitness@gmail.com`
   - Password: `Yoga@2024`
   - ✓ **Check "Auto Confirm User"**
4. Click **"Create user"**

### Step 2: Link Admin to Database

In Supabase Dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, name, phone, student_id, role)
SELECT id, 'yogafitness@gmail.com', 'Admin User', '9876543210', 'ADMIN001', 'admin'
FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'yogafitness@gmail.com'
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 3: Create Sample Student (Optional)

Repeat Steps 1-2 with:
- Email: `student@iips.edu`
- Password: `Student@123`

Then run the SQL from `CREATE_USERS.sql` file.

### Step 4: Test the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
- Visit `/register` to register a new user
- Visit `/login` to login with existing credentials
- Admin login redirects to `/admin`
- User login redirects to `/user/dashboard`

## Testing Registration Flow

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/register`
2. Select user type (Student or Other User)
3. Fill in:
   - Full Name
   - Email
   - Phone Number
   - Student/User ID
   - Password
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You'll be automatically logged in
6. Redirected to user dashboard
7. Check notification bell for welcome message

## Admin Login

2. Enter:
   - Email: `yogafitness@gmail.com`
   - Password: `Yoga@2024`
3. Access admin panel at `/admin`

## Database Tables

1. **users** - User profiles with roles

1. Create admin user in Supabase Dashboard
2. Run the SQL to link admin to database
3. Start dev server
4. Register a test student
5. Login as admin to manage events

Everything is ready to go! The application is fully functional with Supabase integration.
